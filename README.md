Set up Dev Environment
1. nvm to use node 10
2. run "npm run watch" to start a compiler and then run "npm run start" to run a dev server that listens to the compiler and auto refreshes the bundle.js as it's compiled. However, there is no hot module reloading: you have to manually refresh the browser to get the new brundle.js downloaded.
