User Goal
* find an activity to do 
** activity type must match
** time availability must match
** OPTIONAL: location (if needs to be together physically) must match criteria <--- HARD.  What level of detail?  Maybe we can start with computer games like LOL and Dota and WOW? 
Task: look into current method on how to find a guild etc.  

* Maybe the activity is conversation! Conversation topics you're interested and enjoy talking about.
